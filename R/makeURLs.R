#' Data Project: How could social media news influence the stock returns?
#'
#' The fluctuation in the stock market can be reflected and predicted through the most updated news.
#' This project takes news data as an illustration. Specifically, our goal is to find a method
#' to collect and combine both sturctured (numerical) data from Yahoo Finance and unsturctured (text)
#' data from NY Times together by web scraping data from APIs and further text cleaning.
